    "**General setup:**\n",
    "Udacity carried out by Udacity in order to separate students into a control and experimental group. The idea behind it was that the experimental group was asked about the time they would be able to spend on the courses when clicking the stage “start free trial”. However, the control group did not receive this question.\n",
    "The hypothesis was that this setup in the experimental group would result in less student frustration as there would be a clearer separation between students spending enough time and potentially not leaving after the free trial and therefore increase payments to Udactiy, whereas the students without enough time would be directed towards free content.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metrics:**\n",
    "The unit of diversion is a cookie, although if the student enrolls in the free trial, they are tracked by user-id from that point forward. The same user-id cannot enroll in the free \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We first divided our metrics into invariant metric being a metric that should not be affected by the changes in the experiment and evaluation metrics, which are metrics used to measure the impact or the changes made in the experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose the following invariant and evaluation metrics:\n",
    "- Invariant metrics:\n",
    "    - Number of cookies\n",
    "    - Number of clicks:\n",
    "    - Click-through-probability\n",
    "- Evaluation metrics\n",
    "    - Gross conversion:\n",
    "    - Net conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Secondly, we calculated the analytical standard deviation for our two evaluation metrics: Gross conversion and Net conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "3. After this, we looked at the sizing and used the analytical standard deviation as well as Minimum Detectable Effect and baseline conversion rates to calculate the necessary sample size and total sample size. \n",
    "Once we had this we were able to calculate the number of pages views = Total Sample Size / / Click-through-probability\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Bonferroni correction correction: we chose not to use the Bonferroni correction for the following reasons\n",
    "usually the Bonferroni correction is used to adjust p-values in order to control the family-wise error rate (FWER) in multiple hypothesis testing or in other words the purpose is to reduce the probability of a type I error (false-positive) when making a larger number of hypothesis tests. In this case we are only a control and experimental group with 23 observations. Hence, the number of tests is fairly small and I will not use the Bonferroni correction.\n",
    "Besides, the Bonferroni correction is known for some quite heavy assumptions:\n",
    "    - Conservative approach resulting in quite low adjusted significance levels, which can make it quite difficult to detect true effects\n",
    "    - Independence assumption: Bonferroni correction assumes tests to be conducted independent of each other. This is not necessarily the case for Gross and Net Conversion\n",
    "    - Type II error rate:  Bonferroni correction can indirectly affect the Type 2 error rate\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In the next step we checked the Duration vs. Exposure. Here we found that allocating 100 % of the traffic to the experiment was too risky and decided to go with 50% of the traffic resulting in 35 days to run the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. After this, we performed Sanity checks for our three invariant metrics:\n",
    "Number of cookies\n",
    "Number of clicks:.\n",
    "Click-through-probability\n",
    "We found that all metrics  passed the sanity check as all observed values were between the upper and lower bounds of the CI. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. After this, we performed the Effect Size Tests to see if a difference between a control and experimental group is also practically significant.\n",
    "We have seen that our Gross Conversion Metric is very well practically and statistically relevant. However, the Net Conversion Metric is NOT practically and statistically.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Finally we ran a Sign test, calculated the p-value to check, if we had evidence to reject null hypothesis and the effect was statistically relevant\n",
    "We found that: \n",
    "    - Gross Conversion: The effect between the control and experimental group can be considered as significant and the observed effect is not random.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Net Conversion: the effect between the control and experimental group can be considered as insignificant and the observed effect is by random chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. No discrepancies between the effect size test and the sign test were found\n"

    "My suggestion is to decrease the number of students leaving after the trial by encouraging them to stay longer once they want to leave after the free trial. This could happen through **discoiunts** for the first three months compared to the original price. This way, Udacity **might earn less in the short-term, but motivate and persuade students to stay long-term**.\n",
    "To do so, a modified version of the homepage after the free trial would be needed offering the discussed discount when trying to end the free trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Experiment design:**\n",
    "- For students that have just started the free trial we would separate  them between a control and an experimental group randomly. The experimental group would get to  see the discount features, whereas the control group would still get the old homepage\n",
    "\n",
    "**Null Hypothesis:**\n",
    "- The new discount feature **will not increase** the retention of students (remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative Hypothesis:**\n",
    "- The new discount feature **will increase** the retention of students (remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unit of Diversion:**\n",
    "- As we would need to control the retention  between experimental and control group, the user-id seems an appropriate unit of diversion \n",
    "\n",
    "**Invariant Metric:**\n",
    "- The invariant metric is a metric that should not be affected by the changes. Hence, the **number of user-ids** having enrolled in the free-trial could be suitable. In this case a cookie will be necessary in the unit of diversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation Metric:**\n",
    "- Evaluation metrics are metrics used to measure the impact or the changes made in the experiment. Hence, the **Retention** would make sense in order to see if students stay enrolled longer. We could also use the **net conversion** again to check for the improvement of the financial performance."
